| Part     |      Goal   |  
|:--------:|:------------|
| 1| You can write simple programs, which read user input and for example basic calculations. You know the terms **variable**, **conditional** or **if**, and **while-loop** and can use them in the programs. |
| 2| You know the logical operators, such as **and**, **or** and **not** and can use them in conditionals and while-loops. You know what **methods**, **method parameters** and **method return** mean, how to create them and what happens in the program while a method is used. |
| 3| You can comment your code and understand how naming variables affects the readibility of code. You understand the basics of **lists** and can use them in your programs, and iterate through a list. |
| 4| You comprehend the terms **file** and **filesystem** and can read a simple file with your program. You know the basics for **Object oriented programming** and how to use this information in your programs. |
| 5| You know the different **data types** and how they differ from each other. You can **overload** methods and **constructors**. You can use all these in your programs. |
| 6| You understand the dfference between **static** and **non-static** classes and methods. You can separate **user interface** from program logic. |


The courses are graded on a scale of 0-5, individually. The grade comprises of the amount of exercises done. There will be no exam.
